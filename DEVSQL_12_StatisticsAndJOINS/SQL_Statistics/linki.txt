--	temp stats:

When statistics on a read-only database or read-only snapshot are missing or stale, the Database Engine creates and maintains temporary statistics in tempdb. When the Database Engine creates temporary statistics, the statistics name is appended with the suffix _readonly_database_statistic to differentiate the temporary statistics from the permanent statistics. The suffix _readonly_database_statistic is reserved for statistics generated by SQL Server. Scripts for the temporary statistics can be created and reproduced on a read-write database. When scripted, Management Studio changes the suffix of the statistics name from _readonly_database_statistic to _readonly_database_statistic_scripted.

Only SQL Server can create and update temporary statistics. However, you can delete temporary statistics and monitor statistics properties using the same tools that you use for permanent statistics:

Delete temporary statistics using the DROP STATISTICS statement.
Monitor statistics using the sys.stats and sys.stats_columns catalog views. sys_stats includes the is_temporary column, to indicate which statistics are permanent and which are temporary.

Because temporary statistics are stored in tempdb, a restart of the SQL Server service causes all temporary statistics to disappear.
